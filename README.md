The object is to get the calendar to work with moment.js to to display local time and to change the colors of the past present and future time. The calendar is to have 1 hour time slots for the time range to schedule your events and also contain the following fields; The time, a field to hold the user input, and the save button to store the input. 
By clicking the save button this will store the time and the input in the locatStorage setting.

The application displays timeblocks for standard business hours (9 a.m. to 5 p.m.).

Each timeblock contains an input field and save button.

Clicking a timeblock's "Save" button stores the input text in local storage, allowing the text to persist when the application is refreshed.
